This is a data analysis project that is not yet public. All data sources are, for now, encrypted. 

If you are not one of my collaborators, and have not been added by e.g. your Github key, there's no much use in cloning this repo. 

Packages required:

* tidyverse
* glue
* RQDA: to handle qualitative data codings
* irr: to measure inter-rater agreement
* hadley/secure: to encrypt raw data
* googlesheets: to retrieve data on Google Sheets

Tags:

* "round1": RQDA database and analysis code prior to first round of coding consensus.
